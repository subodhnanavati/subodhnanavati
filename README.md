- 👋 Hi, I’m @subodhnanavati. I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself and express my interest in sharing my expertise in the field of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. With over 40 years of experience in this specialized area, I have developed a special interest in oral premalignant disorders and have become a recognized speaker on the subject.
Recently few companies have introduced oral health screenings based on biomarkers studies for oral premalignant disorders and oral cancer which will help oral health professionals diagnose oral cancer at an early stage. I appreciate the opportunity to teach more about this important advancement in oral health screening.
I am seeking opportunities to deliver lectures and educational sessions on oral premalignant disorders at dental and medical schools, as well as conferences and professional events. I believe that my extensive experience and knowledge in this area could provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals and students.
I would be very interested in exploring potential collaboration opportunities with your organizations to contribute to educational initiatives in this important area of oral health.


In the battle against oral cancer, late detection is a recurring theme I've encountered in my interactions with patients. This common narrative is regrettable and calls for a change. 

Oral cancer, a daunting ailment that affects the lining of the lips, mouth, or upper throat, often begins subtly. It might start as a painless white patch in the mouth, gradually thickening, developing red patches, and eventually evolving into a persistent, unhealing ulcer. This stealthy progression makes early detection difficult, but this challenge doesn't have to equate to a death sentence. 

Now is the time to revolutionize oral cancer screening. Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands as a pivotal ally in our fight against this disease. By leveraging the power of AI, we can reinvent the approach to early detection, making it more precise, efficient, and crucially, accessible to all. 

AI's potential to dismantle healthcare barriers is phenomenal, facilitating screening to extend even to the world's remotest corners. Armed with this technology, we gain the ability to detect oral cancer at its nascent stages, significantly amplifying the chances of successful treatment and saving precious lives. 

As we teeter on the edge of this technological revolution in oral healthcare, let's keep our objective clear – our mission isn't just to combat oral cancer but to prevent it. This journey of prevention starts with early detection. Let's seize the potential of AI and, united, alter the course in the battle against oral cancer. 

I look forward to the possibility of discussing this matter further and if necessary, share with you my brief biodata and some of my presentations.
Thank you,
With regards,
Dr. Subodh Nanavati.
